# Dental-Image-Repository
DIR (Dental Image repository)  present a 3D dental Database for benchmarking detection, segmentation and classification. Each point in the 3D point cloud has been segmented and classified, allowing point evaluation.
#  Data Description
This dataset contains 3D data from dental plaster models. Figure 1 show a photo from the test model, approximatively 350.000 points are acquire per piece. the acquisition was made on image laboratory of National University. The dataset contain five PLY files with approximately 300.000 points each. Each file contain a list of (X, Y, Z, label)points, where XYZ correspond to geometric object, label is the object identifier obtained.
